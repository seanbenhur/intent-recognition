# Intent Recognition with Pytorch and Flask REST API
## Description
This motivation of the project is to classify the various intents of  the users into seven categories using methods of Deep Learning, I have used various architectures such as <br>
<ol>
	<li>RNN</li>
	<li>Bidirectional LSTM</li>
	<li>Fastext</li>
	<li>CNN</li>
	<li>BERT</li>
</ol>
> Based on the Results, I have created a  flask rest api
## Installation

If you want to test this on your own machine I would recommend you run it in a virtual environment or use Docker, as not to affect the rest of your files.

### Python venv

In Python3 you can set up a virtual environment with

```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Or by installing virtualenv with pip by doing
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
```
Then creating the environment with
```bash
virtualenv venv
```
and finally activating it with
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
